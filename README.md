# Read m-clust .t files.

This matlab function is intended to read the .t files generated by M-Clust (http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/MClust/MClust.html). M-Clust can generate either 32- or 64-bit integer .t files. The 32-bit files have the standard extension ".t". The 64-bit files have the extension ".t64". The function will automatically decide how to read the file based on the extension.

Typically, 32-bit integers should be enought to store the spikes timestamps. However, I will recommend to save all your .t files as 64-bit integers. That way you will not run on the problem of the timestamps being clipped to the largest possible integer with 32-bits, which is 4294967296. If timestamps are being recorded with a resolution of a 100th of a microsecond, then 32-bit integers will allow a maximum recording time of about seven hours before start clipping.
